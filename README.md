# Notice

This integration intends to help a user control multiple climate devices in a zone
by providing a single thermostat and control logic behind-the scenes that takes care
of setting the devices' thermostats. An example use-case is combining floor heating
with AC heating in winter time.

## Why?

The challenge with combining multiple climate devices in a single zone is that typically
one device will take all the actions while the second never kicks in due to its thermostat
reading outside the control limits. The climax coordinator avoids this by using other metrics
to track whether a climate device's action is needed.

**This component will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`binary_sensor` | Show something `True` or `False`.
`sensor` | Show info from blueprint API.
`switch` | Switch something `True` or `False`.

## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `integration_blueprint`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/integration_blueprint/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Integration blueprint"

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/integration_blueprint/translations/en.json
custom_components/integration_blueprint/translations/nb.json
custom_components/integration_blueprint/translations/sensor.nb.json
custom_components/integration_blueprint/__init__.py
custom_components/integration_blueprint/api.py
custom_components/integration_blueprint/binary_sensor.py
custom_components/integration_blueprint/config_flow.py
custom_components/integration_blueprint/const.py
custom_components/integration_blueprint/manifest.json
custom_components/integration_blueprint/sensor.py
custom_components/integration_blueprint/switch.py
```

## Configuration is done in the UI
